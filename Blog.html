                    <h5 class="text-primary">FTP Client</h5>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                      You can transfer files from your computer to your WordPress site using the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) protocol. You will require an FTP client, a desktop application that links your computer to your WordPress hosting account, in order to use FTP.</p>
                      
                      <p>It offers a simple graphics user interface so you can conduct all FTP operations on your WordPress site, including copying, uploading, deleting, renaming, and editing files and folders.</p>
                      
                      <p>WordPress can be used without installing an FTP software. When you are unable to enter the WordPress admin area, an FTP client can help you rapidly fix common WordPress errors.   
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="text-primary">How to use FTP Client</h5>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                      For FTP access, you'll need a login and password that you can use to log in to your WordPress website.</p>
                      
                      <p>The email you received when you first began your blog and registered for a web hosting account contains this information.</p>
                      
                      <p>You can also find this information in the cPanel dashboard of your web hosting account or by asking the support, who will send it to you.</p>
                      
                      <p>You can link to your website once you have this data.</p>
                      
                      <p>Launching your FTP client is the first step. Next, input your FTP username, password, and host (which is typically your website address, such as wpbeginner.com), and then select the connect button.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="img/ftpclient.jpg">

                    <p class="text-muted">
                      The host of your website is usually its address (e.g. wpbeginner.com).</p>
                      
                      <p>If you leave the port entry blank, your FTP client will communicate on port 21 using the plain FTP protocol.</p>
                      
                      <p>Use port 22 when connecting to your server via SFTP, which encrypts data before transmitting it to your web server. By doing this, it is less likely that hackers will steal your FTP password or collect information.</p>
                    

                    <h5 class="text-primary">Web Server</h5>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                      Hardware and software are the two components that make up a web server. A physical computer or group of linked devices constitutes the hardware. The data for HTML pages, JavaScript scripts, CSS stylesheets, and images are stored on this machine.</p>
                      
                      <p>The software on a web server manages how the server gets and transmits data over the internet. The program takes requests from users' browsers, finds the required files, and then uses HTTP to serve them (HTTP). In essence, the software transforms the data on your site into text that is readable by your visitors. Today, HTTPS is widely used by online servers for more safe transfers.</p>
                      
                      <p>Other protocols, like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), are widely used in online server software (FTP). Additionally, numerous Operating Systems (OS), like Windows or Linux, are designed for different types of software. </p>
                      
                      <p>The majority of the time, the web server software will be chosen by your hosting company. However, some hosts will let you pick and run the software of your choice.</p>
